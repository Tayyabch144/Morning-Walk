        <h2>Morning Walk</h2>
        <p>Morning walk is essential for everybody living in the world.A morning walk is often described as the best start to a day.</br> In the modern world, where our lives are filled with machines and screens, a morning walk brings us back to nature.</br> It is the simplest and most effective form of exercise that requires no money or special equipment.</br>

The atmosphere in the early morning is very different from the rest of the day.</br> The air is cool, fresh, and free from the smoke and noise of city traffic. When we walk in a park or an open field during the sunrise, we experience the beauty of the world. </br>The dew drops on the green grass look like tiny diamonds, and the sweet singing of birds creates a peaceful environment that heals the mind.</p>
